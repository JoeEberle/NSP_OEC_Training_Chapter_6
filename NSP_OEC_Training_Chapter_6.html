<li><strong>Inferior (Caudal)</strong>: Toward the feet or below. Example: The feet are inferior to the knees.</li>
<li><strong>Medial</strong>: Toward the midline of the body. Example: The nose is medial to the eyes.</li>
<li><strong>Lateral</strong>: Away from the midline of the body. Example: The arms are lateral to the chest.</li>
<li><strong>Proximal</strong>: Closer to the point of attachment to the body. Example: The elbow is proximal to the wrist.</li>
<li><strong>Distal</strong>: Farther from the point of attachment to the body. Example: The fingers are distal to the elbow.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="body-movement">Body Movement:</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Flexion</strong>: Decreasing the angle between two body parts. Example: Bending the elbow is flexion of the forearm.</li>
<li><strong>Extension</strong>: Increasing the angle between two body parts.  Example: Straightening the knee is extension of the leg.</li>
<li><strong>Abduction</strong>: Moving a body part away from the midline. Example: Raising the arm sideways is abduction.</li>
<li><strong>Adduction</strong>: Moving a body part toward the midline.  Example: Bringing the arm back to the body is adduction.</li>
<li><strong>Rotation</strong>: Turning a body part around its axis.  Example: Turning the head to the left or right is rotation.</li>
<li><strong>Pronation</strong>: Rotating the forearm so the palm faces down. Example: Turning the palm downward is pronation.</li>
<li><strong>Supination</strong>: Rotating the forearm so the palm faces up. Example: Turning the palm upward is supination.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="body-position">Body Position:</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Supine</strong>: Lying on the back, face up. Example: The patient is placed in a supine position for the exam.</li>
<li><strong>Prone</strong>: Lying on the stomach, face down. Example: The patient is in a prone position during certain back surgeries.</li>
<li><strong>Lateral (Side-Lying)</strong>: Lying on one side. Example: The recovery position places the patient in a lateral position.</li>
<li><strong>Fowler’s Position</strong>: Sitting upright or inclined at an angle. Example: A patient with breathing difficulty is placed in Fowler's position.</li>
</ol>
<p>These terms are used in anatomy and medical settings to describe locations, movements, and positions accurately.</p>
<h2 id="2-human-bodys-major-organs-their-location-and-their-function">2. Human body’s major organs, their location, and their function:</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Heart</strong>: Located in the chest, between the lungs. It pumps blood throughout the body, supplying oxygen and nutrients while removing carbon dioxide and waste.</li>
<li><strong>Lungs</strong>: Located on either side of the chest. They exchange oxygen from the air with carbon dioxide from the blood.</li>
<li><strong>Brain</strong>: Located in the skull. It controls all body functions, including movement, thought, emotions, and sensory processing.</li>
<li><strong>Liver</strong>: Located in the upper right abdomen. It processes nutrients, detoxifies harmful substances, and produces bile for digestion.</li>
<li><strong>Stomach</strong>: Located in the upper abdomen, just below the ribs. It breaks down food using digestive acids and enzymes.</li>
<li><strong>Pancreas</strong>: Located behind the stomach. It produces digestive enzymes and regulates blood sugar by releasing insulin and glucagon.</li>
<li><strong>Kidneys</strong>: Located in the lower back, one on each side of the spine. They filter waste from the blood, regulate fluid balance, and produce urine.</li>
<li><strong>Small Intestine</strong>: Located in the abdomen. It digests food and absorbs nutrients into the bloodstream.</li>
<li><strong>Large Intestine</strong>: Located in the abdomen, surrounding the small intestine. It absorbs water and forms solid waste (stool).</li>
<li><strong>Spleen</strong>: Located in the upper left abdomen. It filters blood, recycles old red blood cells, and helps the immune system.</li>
<li><strong>Gallbladder</strong>: Located under the liver. It stores bile produced by the liver and releases it into the small intestine to aid in fat digestion.</li>
<li><strong>Bladder</strong>: Located in the pelvis. It stores urine until it is expelled from the body.</li>
<li><strong>Esophagus</strong>: Located in the chest, connecting the throat to the stomach. It carries food and liquids from the mouth to the stomach.</li>
<li><strong>Thyroid</strong>: Located in the neck. It regulates metabolism, energy production, and growth through hormone production.</li>
<li><strong>Adrenal Glands</strong>: Located on top of each kidney. They produce hormones like adrenaline and cortisol that regulate metabolism, stress response, and blood pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Skin</strong>: Covers the entire body. It acts as a protective barrier, regulates temperature, and allows sensation.</li>
<li><strong>Bones</strong>: Located throughout the body. They provide structural support, protect organs, and enable movement through muscle attachment.</li>
<li><strong>Muscles</strong>: Located throughout the body. They enable movement, posture, and generate heat by contracting.</li>
<li><strong>Uterus (female)</strong>: Located in the pelvis. It supports the development of a fetus during pregnancy.</li>

<li><strong>Muscular System</strong>: Allows movement of the body and its parts through the contraction and relaxation of muscles while also maintaining posture and generating heat.</li>
<li><strong>Respiratory System</strong>: Facilitates the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the body and the environment through the lungs and airways.</li>
<li><strong>Endocrine System</strong>: Produces and releases hormones that regulate metabolism, growth, reproduction, and other bodily functions.</li>
<li><strong>Lymphatic (and Immune) System</strong>: Defends the body against infections, removes waste and toxins, and transports lymph, a fluid containing infection-fighting white blood cells.</li>
<li><strong>Urinary (Excretory) System</strong>: Filters waste products from the blood and removes them from the body in the form of urine, while also maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance.</li>
<li><strong>Excretory System</strong>: Eliminates metabolic waste products and toxins from the body through processes in the skin, lungs, liver, and kidneys.</li>
<li><strong>Reproductive System</strong>: Enables the production of offspring through the creation and delivery of reproductive cells.</li>
</ol>
<p>These systems work together to maintain the body's overall homeostasis and functionality.</p>

<h2 id="how-blood-flows-through-the-heart">How Blood flows through the heart :</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Blood enters the heart</strong> through the superior and inferior vena cava.</li>

<li>The <strong>right ventricle contracts</strong>, sending blood through the pulmonary valve into the pulmonary arteries.</li>
<li><strong>Blood travels to the lungs</strong>, where it picks up oxygen and releases carbon dioxide.</li>
<li><strong>Oxygenated blood returns</strong> to the heart through the pulmonary veins into the left atrium.</li>
<li>The <strong>left atrium contracts</strong>, pushing blood through the mitral (bicuspid) valve into the left ventricle.</li>
<li>The <strong>left ventricle contracts</strong>, sending oxygenated blood through the aortic valve into the aorta.</li>
<li><strong>Blood is distributed</strong> to the rest of the body through the aorta, delivering oxygen to tissues.</li>
</ol>
