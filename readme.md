## 6.1. Identify and properly use each anatomic term for body direction, movement, and position.

Here’s a brief overview of key anatomic terms for body direction, movement, and position, along with examples of their proper use:

## Body Direction:
1. **Anterior (Ventral)**: Toward the front of the body. Example: The sternum is anterior to the heart.
2. **Posterior (Dorsal)**: Toward the back of the body. Example: The spine is posterior to the stomach.
3. **Superior (Cranial)**: Toward the head or above. Example: The head is superior to the neck.
4. **Inferior (Caudal)**: Toward the feet or below. Example: The feet are inferior to the knees.
5. **Medial**: Toward the midline of the body. Example: The nose is medial to the eyes.
6. **Lateral**: Away from the midline of the body. Example: The arms are lateral to the chest.
7. **Proximal**: Closer to the point of attachment to the body. Example: The elbow is proximal to the wrist.
8. **Distal**: Farther from the point of attachment to the body. Example: The fingers are distal to the elbow.

## Body Movement:
1. **Flexion**: Decreasing the angle between two body parts. Example: Bending the elbow is flexion of the forearm.
2. **Extension**: Increasing the angle between two body parts.  Example: Straightening the knee is extension of the leg.
3. **Abduction**: Moving a body part away from the midline. Example: Raising the arm sideways is abduction.
4. **Adduction**: Moving a body part toward the midline.  Example: Bringing the arm back to the body is adduction.
5. **Rotation**: Turning a body part around its axis.  Example: Turning the head to the left or right is rotation.
6. **Pronation**: Rotating the forearm so the palm faces down. Example: Turning the palm downward is pronation.
7. **Supination**: Rotating the forearm so the palm faces up. Example: Turning the palm upward is supination.

## Body Position:
1. **Supine**: Lying on the back, face up. Example: The patient is placed in a supine position for the exam.
2. **Prone**: Lying on the stomach, face down. Example: The patient is in a prone position during certain back surgeries.
3. **Lateral (Side-Lying)**: Lying on one side. Example: The recovery position places the patient in a lateral position.
4. **Fowler’s Position**: Sitting upright or inclined at an angle. Example: A patient with breathing difficulty is placed in Fowler's position.

These terms are used in anatomy and medical settings to describe locations, movements, and positions accurately.


## 2. Human body’s major organs, their location, and their function:

1. **Heart**: Located in the chest, between the lungs. It pumps blood throughout the body, supplying oxygen and nutrients while removing carbon dioxide and waste.
2. **Lungs**: Located on either side of the chest. They exchange oxygen from the air with carbon dioxide from the blood.

## How Blood flows through the heart :

1. **Blood enters the heart** through the superior and inferior vena cava.
2. Deoxygenated blood **flows into the right atrium**.
3. The **right atrium contracts**, pushing blood through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle.
4. The **right ventricle contracts**, sending blood through the pulmonary valve into the pulmonary arteries.
5. **Blood travels to the lungs**, where it picks up oxygen and releases carbon dioxide.
6. **Oxygenated blood returns** to the heart through the pulmonary veins into the left atrium.
7. The **left atrium contracts**, pushing blood through the mitral (bicuspid) valve into the left ventricle.
8. The **left ventricle contracts**, sending oxygenated blood through the aortic valve into the aorta.
9. **Blood is distributed** to the rest of the body through the aorta, delivering oxygen to tissues.

## Major bones in the body, along with their location:

1. **Skull**: Located in the head, it protects the brain and forms the structure of the face.
2. **Mandible**: The lower jawbone, located in the face, responsible for mouth movement.
3. **Clavicle (Collarbone)**: Located between the shoulder blade and the sternum (breastbone), it helps support shoulder movement.
4. **Sternum (Breastbone)**: Located in the center of the chest, it connects the ribs and helps protect the heart and lungs.
5. **Ribs**: Located in the chest, these bones form the rib cage, which protects the heart, lungs, and other internal organs.
6. **Humerus**: The upper arm bone, located between the shoulder and elbow.
7. **Radius**: One of the two forearm bones, located on the thumb side of the forearm.
8. **Ulna**: The second forearm bone, located on the pinky side of the forearm.
9. **Spine (Vertebrae)**: A column of bones located in the back, stretching from the neck to the lower back, protecting the spinal cord.
10. **Pelvis**: Located in the lower torso, it supports the weight of the upper body and protects organs in the lower abdomen.
11. **Femur**: The thigh bone, located between the hip and knee, is the longest and strongest bone in the body.
12. **Patella (Kneecap)**: Located in the front of the knee joint, it protects the knee and assists with leg extension.
13. **Tibia (Shinbone)**: The larger, weight-bearing bone of the lower leg, located between the knee and ankle.
13. **Fibula**: The smaller bone of the lower leg, located alongside the tibia, providing stability to the ankle.
13. **Carpals**: A group of small bones located in the wrist.
13. **Metacarpals**: The bones located in the hand, between the wrist and fingers.
13. **Phalanges**: The bones in the fingers and toes.
13. **Tarsals**: A group of bones located in the ankle and foot.
13. **Metatarsals**: The bones located in the foot, between the ankle and toes.
